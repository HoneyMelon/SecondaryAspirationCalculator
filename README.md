A small program to calculate your sims secondary aspiration based on their interests. <br>
You can add a screenshot of the interest panel and let the program read the values automatically (see example screenshot) or just put them in yourself. <br>
The scores are calculated as follows: <br> <br>

knowledge: 2x paranormal + work + environment + sci-fi <br>
family: 2x food + toys + animals + school <br>
popularity: 2x travel + culture + sports + weather <br>
romance: 2x fashion + health + travel + entertainment <br>
pleasure: 2x entertainment + food + culture + fashion <br>
fortune: 2x money + politics + crime + work <br> <br>
